memory using dynamic allocation.
Assignment Slip – 3
1. Design a class for a Student Database that allows the addition, deletion, and search of
student records using static members and friend functions.
2. Create a pointer-based implementation of a class where objects are dynamically created
and manipulated using the this pointer and constructors/destructors.
Assignment Slip – 4
